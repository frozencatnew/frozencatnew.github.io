<pre>so this is like my personal website/blog cause i felt like it 
i am from the epic land of australia the only thing notable about where i live is someone here caused a fish invasion here 
i like to just play around with tech stuff like modding consoles and i collect games for them too also i like pokemon (psyduck is the best)
i used to be obese but i lost weight
